# Things to do

* More indicators - when the server supports them
* better highlighting of the current node
* better hovering to show parents
* allow the user to control the maximum depth shown (especially for big projects)
* better styling in general
* per-indicator controls:
  * colour scale tweaking?
  * age ranges for git stats?
  * build a languages used key?
  * display of binary files
  * sizes based on bytes vs sizes based on LOC
  * tweak indentation display (once we have indentation!)
